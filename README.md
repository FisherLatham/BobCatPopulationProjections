# Bobcat Stochastic Modeling
---
### Description:
This group project was for my Mathmetical Modeling class, where we were tasked with developing an age structured model for the endangered Florida female bobcat population.
By making some fundamental assumptions, we were able to develop a Leslie matrix to understand how the population would grow over time across the 16 age classes
of bobcats, and we were able to run 100 trials of a simulation to create a best and worst case scenario given that there is a 4% change of a catastrophe 
every year. The script file contains the MATLAB code that we worked on for the project, and the draft file contains the report that we developed. üê±
